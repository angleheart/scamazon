Completed Amazon giveaway tasks for you - so you don't have to.


This project requires the Java Selenium Library and Chromedriver for browser control.

The purpose of this project is to automatically handle Amazon giveaway advertisements for you.
This allows you to potentially win prizes for watching ads without touching your mouse.

The program will automatically run through pages for you, and can handle most conditions at the time of it's creation.

This program supports multithreading for multiple accounts.

Each account represents one program instance.

As of today, it is likely that Amazon has changed the specific methods for their giveaways.
The giveaway promotion is also not always available.
